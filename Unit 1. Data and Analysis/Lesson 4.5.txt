Lesson 4.5

I chose #3

The Problem
- The satisfaction rate of our IT employees and HR employees are low. This leads to employee churn and poor work performance. We are also running into Simpson's paradox by aggregating at the type level rather than the country level.

The Potential Solution
- Survey the employees 4 times a year in order to gauge their satisfaction. 

The Method of Testing the Solution
- Since we have workers in multiple countries, we will need to understand the differences in culture when it comes to satisfaction. Also, because we are surveying multiple times a year, there is less of a chance that we will catch people on a bad day.
