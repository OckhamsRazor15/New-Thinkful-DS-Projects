Lesson 4.4 Challenge

1. Since 2 different people present the options, their perception by the captives could have swayed the decisions. If they are more afraid of the other, for example. In order for this to work, you would need the same person presenting to the groups. You also have to consider the demographics of the captive groups and make sure that they are close to each other.

2. Since they are going to different planets, the experiment is not the same with both. Mace could be going to planets that are generally leaning more unfavorable. This one actually caused me some trouble as I'm struggling to see some of the bigger issues and how to fix it. 

3. As you are aggregating by job type rather than region, you may run into Simpson's paradox as a problem. A solution would be to break down the regions further so that you can guard against that.

4. Are people who are already working out using the app? We don't have enough background on the people to know what type of people are installing the app. Perhaps an intro questionnaire where you can gauge the user and put them in cohorts.

5. While it could be that version B is easier, it could also be that the smarter students received B. If the copies were stacked together, the B students could have cheated. It could also be random. The fix here would be to have mixed up the tests rather than stacking them.
