1. linear regression - the running times are a continous variable
2. PCA/lasso - we need to pare down the features
3. KNN or SVM- we could see the characteristics of people in jail vs non and see how close they are
4. Naive bayes - figure out what characteristics are important to a recipient
5. PCA/lasso - see #2
6. Random Forest - we have 2 outcomes, it will be easier to use forests and compare users
8. KNN - you can compare like things
9. SVM - easily separate boys vs girls.
